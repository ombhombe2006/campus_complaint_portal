# Simple Demo - Campus Review Portal

This folder contains a **frontend-only demo** version of the Campus Review Portal that works without any backend server setup.

## 🚀 Quick Start

2. No backend server, database, or additional setup required!

## 🔑 Demo Credentials

**User Login:**
- Username: `user1`
- Password: `user123`

**Admin Login:**  
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## ✨ What Works in Demo Mode

✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Shows mock admin interface with sample data
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
✅ **UI/UX Flow**: Complete user journey demonstration

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Mock Data**: JavaScript uses hardcoded sample data instead of API calls
- **Session Storage**: User authentication state stored locally in browser
- **No Backend**: Purely frontend demonstration for UI/UX showcase
- **Original Design**: Same red/white theme and responsive layout

## 📁 Files Modified for Demo

- `js/main.js` - Modified to use mock authentication and sample review data
- `js/user-dashboard.js` - Uses mock data for user reviews/complaints  
- `js/admin-dashboard.js` - Uses mock data for admin management interface

## 💡 Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Quick demonstrations** without technical setup
- **UI/UX showcasing** to stakeholders  
- **Design validation** and feedback collection
- **Presentation purposes** when backend isn't available

**Note**: For the **complete working version** with full backend functionality, database integration, and real API calls, use the main `frontend/`, `backend/`, and `database/` folders.
